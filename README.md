# Fractorp
Nanoscopic C++ Actors, state machines, stackless coroutines, and CSP primitives


Hello,

This is work in progress. It's something that I've been researching 
for a few years now. I'm finally ready to start posting some code.
It will probably take the rest of the year to stabilise.

Check my blog, gists and other projects at github to get an idea of where I'm headed with this.

If you'd like to help out or discuss my work please drop me a line at rossb@audiomulch.com.

Thanks,

Ross B.
