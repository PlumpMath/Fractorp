This folder contains an envolving tutorial about techniques for 
implementing micro-actors.

It also serves as a development platform for emdeer.py, which is a
minimal literate programming tool that generates markdown. Emdeer.py
can convert .cpp source files into markdown. It also compiles them
and merges the output into the markdown. When used in conjunction with
grip and grip_hook.py you can edit the source, then refresh your 
web browser to recompile, regenerate, and view the markdown.

Suggestions and patches welcome. Especially if they simplify things :)

Have fun.
